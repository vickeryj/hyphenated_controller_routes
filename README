HyphenatedControllerRoutes
==========================

This plugin adds support for hyphenated controller names in routing paths.

It consists of two parts, a named route generator for the default routes, and a
modification to ActionController::Resources::Resource which changes the
routes that it generates to use hyphens instead of underscores in the
controller names.

To generate hyphenated default routes call map.add_hyphenated_routes() in 
config.routes.  To use hyphenated resources, call 
map.use_hyphenated_resources().

Calling map.add_hyphenated_routes() before the default routing entry
in config.routes means that the default helpers will create routes in 
the form /:controller-name rather than /:controller_name.

Example
=======
Take for example a controller named ContactUs.  The normal default
routing would recognize paths in the form /contact_us/:action/:id
adding a call to map.add_hyphenated_routes before the default routing
line will create the named route "contact_us" "/contact-us/:action/:id"

If, instead ContactUs is routed using the RESTful map.resources call, 
the standard named routes and helper will be created, but with hyphens
instead of underscores (GET /contact-us index contact_us_url).


Here is a sample config.routes
-

ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|
  
  #a resource that will be mapped with an underscore
  map.resources :non_hyphenated_resources

  #turn on hyphenated resources
  map.use_hyphenated_resources()

  #all following resources will use hyphens (contact-us)
  map.resource :contact_us

  # add hyphenated routes with higher priority than the default routes
  map.add_hyphenated_routes
  
  # Install the default routes
  map.connect ':controller/:action/:id.:format'
  map.connect ':controller/:action/:id'

end
